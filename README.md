# Binary-Semantic-Segmentation-for-Garbage-Detection
* Garbage segmentation for Varanasi City with Drones using Computer Vision techniques.
* Dataset included 1000+ drone images of Varanasi city annotated manually with Label Studio. Used patchify to tackle dataset and U-Net architecture for binary semantic segmentationof garbage patches.
* Final reported model had binary cross entropy of 0.1512 and IOU score of 0.739.
* Exposure : Google Colab, Label Studio, Semantic Segmentation, U-Net Architecture.
